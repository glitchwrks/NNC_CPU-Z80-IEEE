                      NOTE

Several files in NNC-CCS.ZIP appear to be truncated.  They are:

      DIOS.ASM
      EKMSGS.OVR
      FDISK.DOC
      NNC-CPU.DOC
      TX.ASM

Other .COM files may be also.  The .HEX files appear OK.

The files were read using UniForm 12-V (Zenith Z-100 8") which may not
be quite right.
